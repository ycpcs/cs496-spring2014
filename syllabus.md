Topics will include:

-   HTTP
-   Web services
-   Databases, SQL, Object-Relational Mapping

Prerequisites
-------------

CS 201

Textbook

None

Course Structure and Expectations
---------------------------------

Class time will be spent primarily on discussion of reading topics and work on labs and other assignments. In general, we will avoid giving lectures. It is very important that you do the reading; otherwise, it will be difficult for us to use the class time effectively.

Completing the in-class labs is very important, because this will be the primary way we will cover the fundamental techniques that you will need to use in your team project.  If you do not complete a lab in class, we expect you to complete it on your own outside of class.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

By the end of the semester you will be able to

-   Design web and mobile applications
-   Implement web and mobile applications
-   Design and implement rich web user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
-   Design and implement mobile applications using Android
-   Use relational databases for storage and retrieval of persistent data

Policies
--------

### Grades

Grades are assigned on a 100-point scale:

> Numeric Range|Letter Grade
> -------------|------------
> 90-100|A (4.0)
> 87-90|B+ (3.5)
> 80-87|B (3.0)
> 77-80|C+ (2.5)
> 70-77|C (2.0)
> 60-70|D (1.0)
> 0-60|F (0.0)

Your overall grade for the course will be determined as follows:

-   Individual homework: 30% **(&dagger;)**
-   Team project: 65% **(\*)**
-   Attendance and participation: 5%

**(&dagger;)** You must make a good faith effort to complete all of the individual assignments.  We reserve the right to assign a failing grade for the course to any student who does not do this.

**(\*)** You must make a substantial *technical* contribution to your team software project. Although the non-technical contributions you make to your project, such as planning, communication, and organization, are important, you must also make a substantial contribution to the design and implementation of the software. We reserve the right to assign a failing grade for the course to any student who does not do this.

### Course website

Please check the course web page, <http://ycpcs.github.io/cs496-spring2014/>, regularly for important announcements.

### Reading Assignments

Reading assignments are posted in the [Schedule](schedule.html). Each reading assignment will be posted at least 1 week before the class in which the topic will be covered.

We expect you to do each reading **before** class.

### Posting and submission of assignments and labs

Assignments and labs will be posted as zip files on the course web page, <http://ycpcs.github.io/cs496-spring2014/>.

Assignments will be submitted using the server <https://cs.ycp.edu/marmoset/>. You will receive an email containing the username and password you should use for this server.

### Academic Integrity

The college catalog states the following:

> Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated at York College. Academic dishonesty refers to actions such as, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabrication of research, falsification of academic documents, etc., and includes all situations where students make use of the work of others and claim such work as their own.

Please refer to the college catalog for an explanation of the official college policies relating to academic integrity.

The following policy pertains to homework and graded (individual) programming assignments in this course:

> All homework assignments and graded (individual) programming assignments are to be completed individually. I encourage you to discuss high level concepts and strategies with other students, but any work you submit **must be yours alone**.
>
> Direct copying of code or other work from other students, web sites, or other sources **is absolutely forbidden under any circumstances**.
>
> Any sources (books, websites, articles, fellow students, etc.) that you consult in completing an assignment **must be properly acknowledged**. In general, I strongly discourage you from using any resource not explicitly listed in the course syllabus or on the course web page. When you work on a programming assignment, it must be **your** program, not your adaptation of someone else's program.

You are allowed to (and expected to) work with the members of your team on team project(s).

Quizzes and exams must be completed individually.

Any violation of the course's academic integrity policy will be referred to the Dean of Academic Affairs, and could have consequences ranging from a 0 on an assignment to dismissal from the college.

### Late Assignments

Late assignments will be marked down 20% per day late. **No credit will be given for assignments that are more than two (2) days late.**

### Exams

No make-up exams will be given without approval of the instructor prior to class unless proof of extreme emergency or illness is provided. All exams will be open book and open notes.

### Attendance and Participation

We expect you to attend class and participate regularly in class activities. If you miss a class, please notify me in advance. You are responsible for all material covered in class, regardless of whether or not you were present. If you attend and participate in class regularly, you can expect to receive full credit for attendance and participation. Frequent absence and/or lack of participation will reduce the credit you receive for attendance and participation. You are responsible for keeping up with the reading assignments as described in the schedule below.

### Use of Personal Technology in the Classroom

While York College recognizes students’ need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, PDA’s, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate. The college recognizes and supports faculty members’ authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.

### Communication Standards

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and careers. Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize, and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations. In addition, students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study, recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking. Students may be asked to further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication skills.
