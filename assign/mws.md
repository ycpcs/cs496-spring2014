# Minimal Working System

The expectation for the minimal working system is fairly simple:

> Demonstrate something that will give us confidence that you have a good starting point for your system: something that you can build on to add features.

The Minimal Working System should at least partially implement one of your use cases.  It should have either a (human-usable) UI, or expose functionality via a web service, or both.
