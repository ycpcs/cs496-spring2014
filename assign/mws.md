# Minimal Working System

The expectation for the minimal working system is fairly simple:

> Demonstrate something that will give us confidence that you have a good starting point for your system: something that you can build on to add features.

The Minimal Working System should at least partially implement one of your use cases.  It should have either a (human-usable) UI, or expose functionality via a web service, or both.

## Evaluation

We will evaluate your Minimal Working Systems as follows:

* *Below expectations* &mdash; We are not confident that you have a good starting point to build on.  We are concerned that you will not have a working project by the end of the semester.
* *Meets expectations* &mdash; We are satisfied that you have a good start and are on track for a working system by the end of the semester.
* *Exceeds expectations* &mdash; Your system supports substantial functionality and we think you are ahead of the game in terms of having a working project by the end of the semester. (However, don't use this as an excuse to start slacking!)
