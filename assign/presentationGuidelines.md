title: "Presentation Guidelines"
---

As part of your team project, your group will give a presentation of about 10-15 minutes.

Please rehearse your presentation!

Here is a suggested structure for your presentation, with approximate times to spend on each part:

> **1.** Background: (1 minutes) What problem were you trying to solve? Discuss the system requirements.
>
> **2.** Analysis and design: (2 minutes) Discuss your design model. In this part of the presentation, you must show a UML class diagram illustrating the *most important* classes and methods in your system, and how they relate/interact with each other.
>
> **3.** Implementation: (2 minutes) What were the most interesting things you learned when you implemented the system? If you used any interesting programming techniques, this is a good opportunity to discuss them.
>
> **4.** Demonstration: (5 minutes) Show your system working. Demonstrate the most important/interesting features.
>
> **5.** Conclusions: (1 minute) Sum up what you learned. If there are aspects of the project you would do differently if you started again from scratch, mention them. You can also talk about how you might want to extend the system in the future.

Your presentation should include no more than 10 slides.

All of the members of your group must participate in the presentation.

You can either present using your own laptop, or you can use the instructor PC at the front of the room. If you use the instructor PC, make sure it has the software needed to run your project. See me if you need software installed.

**Make sure that your presentation AND DEMO is ready to go immediately when it is your group's turn.**
