The lab activity is described in the Activity\_ section below.

Background
==========

Android UI Widgets
------------------

Most views in an Android application contain various UI widgets that allow user interaction with the program. The types of widgets and their layout can be described either through XML files (good for static layouts) or created dynamically at run time programatically (good for dynamic layouts). We will explore designing UI layouts later in the course. For this lab, the view layout is contained in the *res/layout/main.xml* file which will be loaded by the activity's **.onCreate()** method. An example file for a basic application that simply displays a single line of text is:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:layout_height="fill_parent"
        android:orientation="vertical" >

        <TextView
            android:id="@+id/helloLabel"
            android:layout_width="fill_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:text="@string/hello" />

    </LinearLayout>

Note that the *TextView* (which is basically a label) can be referred to in the application by its *id* (**helloLabel** in this example). The *id* allows us to access and/or modify a UI component. Thus, for example, we could programatically change the text for the label in the above Activity by

    TextView label = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.helloLabel);
    label.SetText("How are you?");

Here the method **.findViewById()** accesses the resources of the application through the *R* object. Note the correspondance between the requested *id* and the one specified in the XML file.

HTTP requests in Android
------------------------

Since Android applications are written in Java, we can utilize many of the same classes as we did on the PC when accessing web services. Thus we can issue requests and receive responses (possibly in JSON or XML) and process them in a similar fashion. In particular, we can use the same [Apache HttpComponents](http://hc.apache.org/). discussed in [Lab 4](lab04.html) (For complete details, [read the tutorial](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/tutorial/html/).) Hence an example web request to the geocoding service from [Lab 4](lab04.html) might be

    // Create HTTP client
    HttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();

    // Create list of request paramater/value pairs
    List<NameValuePair> params = new ArrayList<NameValuePair>();
    params.add(new BasicNameValuePair("postalcode", "17403");
    params.add(new BasicNameValuePair("placeName", "725 Grantley Rd");
    params.add(new BasicNameValuePair("country", "US"));
    params.add(new BasicNameValuePair("username", "ycpcs_cs496"));

    // Create URI
    URI uri;
    uri = URIUtils.createURI("http", "api.geonames.org", -1, "/postalCodeSearchJSON", 
                URLEncodedUtils.format(params, "UTF-8"), null);

    // Create HTTP request from uri
    HttpGet request = new HttpGet(uri);

    // Execute request and get response
    HttpResponse response;
    response = client.execute(request);

    // Obtain the response body
    HttpEntity entity = response.getEntity();

At this point, the web service has provided a JSON or XML response that we need to extract from the response payload and parse accordingly. Since Android is Java based, we can use the same **ObjectMapper** objects from the [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) libraries to create Java objects from the JSON response.

Parsing JSON
------------

To convert the **HttpEntity** object to JSON, we will extract the contents of the response body, use **JSON.getObjectMapper()** to get an **ObjectMapper** method, then use **readValue** to read the JSON-encoded representation:

    MyClass myObj = JSON.getObjectMapper().readValue(resp.getContents(), MyClass.class);
    
Note: If the JSON contains a list of objects, as long as our **POJO** contains a corresponding **List<>** field the **ObjectMapper** will take care of creating the list and assigning the appropriate values to the **List** items.

Activity
========

Starting point code: [CS496\_Lab06.zip](CS496_Lab06.zip).

Your task is to duplicate the functionality from [Lab 4](lab04.html) in an Android application. However now instead of obtaining the street addresses and zip codes from the terminal, in the **CallWebService()** method the information should be retreived from the [EditText](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/EditText.html) widgets from the Activity's UI (refer to *res/layout/activity_main.xml* for the corresponding *id*'s of the widgets). Once the HTTP requests are generated and the JSON responses are parsed using an **ObjectMapper**, the result can be computed and displayed in the **distanceLabel** widget using the **.setText()** method. Thus a sample run in the AVD is

As a reminder of the geocoding API:

> <http://www.geonames.org/export/free-geocoding.html>

You will need to use the following parameters:

-   **postalcode** - the zip code
-   **placeName** - the street address
-   **country** - should be set to "US"
-   **username** - should be set to **ycpcs_cs496**

You can find the (approximate) distance in miles between two **PostalCode** objects (which contains *lat* and *lng* fields) through a **ComputeDistance** controller object which takes two **PostalCode** objects and returns a **Result** object (which simply contains a **double value** field).
