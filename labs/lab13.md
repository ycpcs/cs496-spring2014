title: "Lab 13: Mobile OpenGL"
---

Getting Started
===============

Import [CS496\_Lab13.zip](CS496_Lab13.zip) into Eclipse (**Import-\>General-\>Existing Projects into Workspace-\>Archive File**).

You should see source code for **OpenGLExample**, **OpenGLSurfaceView**, and **OpenGLRenderer**.

Your Tasks
==========

Set up the basic OpenGL framework from [lecture13](../lectures/lecture13.html) free of errors.

**IF** you have an Android device (with SDK 2.2 or higher), you can (try) to attach your device to the computer and deploy the application to the device. You should see a yellow triangle that rotates based on swipe gestures.

**IF** you have a working knowledge of OpenGL (particularly GLSL), try to add additional geometry and/or effects.

**IF** you have neither an Android device or knowledge of OpenGL, you may work on the current assignment or your project.
